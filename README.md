# Text-File-Analysis
Write a program that takes two inputs from the user
1. Allow the user to select a text file using a standard file dialog. 
2. Allow the user to type in a word to use for analysis of that text file.

The word chosen by the user is then used to analyze the file selected by the user to do the following:
1.	Count the number of times the word occurs in the file.
2.	Count the number of words used in the file.
3.	Give a percentage of the word selected vs. the overall word count.
